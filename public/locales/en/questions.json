      "question": "I can't orgasm without a vibrator.",
      "answers": [
        "In that case, I would immediately ask how much it bothers you. The situation itself is very common and understandable. The vibrator provides stimulation that is difficult to reproduce in partner sex. What feelings are behind this statement? If they are strong enough and causing concern, then you can retrain yourself and gradually expand your range of pleasure through special techniques, transitioning from vibrator stimulation to manual stimulation or penile stimulation. But this is a process that takes time and effort. ",
        "If these thoughts do not significantly affect the quality of your sexual life, then vibrator stimulation can be added to partner sex on a regular basis. This solution works for many people.",
        "So, in short, the answer is: there is a solution, but do you need it?"

      "question": "15 years together, decreased libido, stereotyped sex, other men don't particularly excite fantasy either. How to break out of this vicious circle?",
      "answers": [
        "It's not exactly a circle. More likely a curve that is typical for many long-term couples. But you mentioned that other men don't particularly excite you either, so the question is: is this related to your current partner or to your own libido.",
        "If it's the former, the shortest answer would be to read Esther Perel's book 'Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence'. But be prepared to focus on your sexual relationships and dedicate time to them.",
        "If it's the latter, it's a bit more complicated, as additional questions are needed. Do you still masturbate, do you have erotic dreams, how is your overall life energy, has it always been this way or have the changes been quite sudden? Decreased libido is one of the most common issues, with many different reasons behind it. But you can always start with the main question: why do you need sex?"

      "question": "I often have erotic dreams, but they are always filled with anxiety and I never reach a 'climax'. These dreams bring more tension than joy. Does this mean something?",
      "answers": [
        "Dreams are about our unconscious processes that are not suppressed by defense mechanisms and conscious control. Therefore, it is best to interpret them in conjunction with life events. But if we try to answer the question, I would pay attention to the tension you are talking about. If by 'climax' you mean orgasm, then it is a quite common phenomenon. Whats more, experiencing an orgasm in a dream, which often wakes a person up, is actually way more rare than just feeling strong excitement from a fantasy. And the tension is a natural reaction to the fact that the release did not happen. You can consider how to handle this specifically for yourself. You might try to fulfill your sexual potential after waking up, if the desire still remains and if it is possible."

      "question": "How to extend the time of sexual intercourse with a partner?",
      "answers": [
        "We lack some numbers here, of course. What it means is that if you want, for example, an hour, then I have one answer, and if you want an average of 10-15 minutes, then another. If we exclude organic violations and and use 10-15 minute time as a benchmark, then this is the dotted line method. Active stimulation should be replaced by a type of caress  that decreases your arousal. In this case, understanding of what turns you on a lot, what turns you on average, and what slows you down completely will help well. It does not depend on whether you are a man or a woman. As soon as it becomes clear that the point of no return is coming soon, you need to switch to another type of stimulation â€” less triggering for your arousal. Communication with a partner is definitely needed here, so that the whole process is more understandable and smooth for both sides. Here is a useful exercise for couples: take a body drawing and mark erogenous zones on it, which are highly arousing, medium and not at all exciting and invite your partner to do the same about them.  Then swap your pictures and discuss them."

      "question": "I experience pain during sexual intercourse",
      "answers": [
        "First of all, it is necessary to rule out any organic cause of this. If a urologist-andrologist or gynecologist has checked and confirmed that there are no somatic disorders, then we might  look at other possible causes.",
        "One more thing: has this always been the case? If yes, then a few follow-up questions would be about how your usual sexual contact happens, how your first sexual experience went, and if you ever have experienced any sexual or physical violence.",
        "If no, then we would focus on when this started happening and if there are any patterns to the pain.",
        "Specialists usually inquire about foreplay: is it sufficient, does it arouse you enough, do you have enough lubrication for penetration to start?",
        "In any case, it is recommended to use additional lubricants and pay special attention to foreplay."

      "question": "I am afraid to enter into sexual relationships after a traumatizing experience.",
      "answers": [
        "I am sorry that you have had such an experience. Without knowing the details, it is difficult to speculate on what caused the unsuccessful experience, but if it is causing fear of repetition, then there is something to work on. I would definitely recommend discussing this issue with a therapist, as it is important to release tension and work through all the feelings you have encountered. Especially if it was your first experience.",
        "Enjoying sex implies trusting your partner and, above all, yourself. If you have had an unsuccessful experience, trust is broken. Therefore, it is important to restore it by understanding the whole situation. Regardless of whether this issue is with a man or a woman, the fear of repeating failure can often haunt a person. For a man, it can manifest in difficulties with erection, for a woman - in the absence of orgasm or difficulties with arousal. So, if fear is stronger than desire, help yourself and seek advice from a specialist."

        "It happens so that a person doesn't turn us on sexually because they no longer excite us as a life partner. When we have a lot of complex emotions towards them that interfere with arousal. ",
